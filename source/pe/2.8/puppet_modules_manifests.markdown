Puppet configures nodes by reading and applying **manifests** written by sysadmins. Manifests contain **classes,** which are chunks of code that configure a specific aspect or feature of a machine.

One or more classes can be stored in a **module,** which is a self-contained bundle of Puppet code. Pre-existing modules can be downloaded from the [Puppet Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com), and most users use a combination of pre-built modules and modules they wrote themselves.
